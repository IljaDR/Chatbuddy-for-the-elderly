# NLP

Emotion recognition with two NLP systems

1. BERT + Huggingface classifier (NLP1)

2. LSTM + CNN (NLP2)

3. Ensemble model with stacking NLP1 and NLP2

## Instructions

Generate BERT and LSTP models (see NLP_LSTM_CNN and BERT directories).

Then create ensemble model as per readme in BERT + concat folder.
